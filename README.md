This repository provides a framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) using OpenAI's generator with Haystack for document retrieval, question answering, and other advanced NLP tasks. By combining the power of Haystackâ€™s retrieval-augmented generation capabilities and OpenAI's state-of-the-art LLM, this project allows users to build highly scalable and efficient systems for extracting information from large collections of documents.
